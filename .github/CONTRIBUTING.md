Some simple rules for posting issues and pull requests for Clockwork for Dynamo

### Issues
- **When posting bugs: Describe what you were doing, what went wrong and what you were expecting to happen.** Include screenshots where applicable.
- **Also when posting bugs: Describe your setup.** (Operating Sytem, Dynamo version, Revit version & build number) If you're using a daily build, please include the filename of the installer.
- **When posting wishes: Go wild.** After all, it's a wish, right?
- **Make sure you are running one of the *supported* Clockwork versions** (see https://github.com/CAAD-RWTH/ClockworkForDynamo#versions)
- **Make sure you are running the *latest available version* of Clockwork** (again, see https://github.com/CAAD-RWTH/ClockworkForDynamo#versions)
- **Make sure your installed version of Clockwork matches the Dynamo version it's installed for** (e.g. Clockwork for Dynamo 0.8.x is *not* installed for Dynamo 0.9.x)
- **Make sure you do *not* have multiple versions of Clockwork installed for one Dynamo version** (e.g. Clockwork for Dynamo 0.7.x and Clockwork for Dynamo 0.8.x installed for the same Dynamo version). Please check your packages folder (typically C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\Dynamo\YOUR_DYNAMO_VERSION\packages)
