Please describe the following:
- **What is happening** (If there are errors, please include them. If it makes sense, please include a screenshot, too.)
- **Expected behaviour**
- **Your setup** (OS, Dynamo version, Revit version & service release number or better yet: build number. If you are using a daily build of Dynamo, please include the file name of the installer.)


Please **make sure these boxes are checked** before submitting your issue:
- [] **I am running one of the *supported* Clockwork versions** (either Clockwork for Dynamo 0.8.x or Clockwork for Dynamo 0.9.x)
- [] **I am running the *latest available version* of Clockwork** (see https://github.com/CAAD-RWTH/ClockworkForDynamo#versions)
